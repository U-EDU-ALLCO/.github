---

## 🧠 3. Learning Design & Methodology

## 🏫 5. Infrastructure & Accessibility  
Centres must be safe, inclusive havens 🛡️ where every learner feels welcome. Blending in-person and remote access 🌐 ensures no barriers to participation. Open Educational Resources 📂 keep knowledge free, fair, and available to all 🌍🔓.

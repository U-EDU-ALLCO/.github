# 🌐 International Standards & Action Plan for Liberal & Responsible U-EDU Academic Centres  
*(Unschool Education for Academic Freedom & Lifelong Learning)*  

---

## 📜 Preamble  
The **U-EDU International Charter** is founded on the belief that **learning is a lifelong, self-directed journey** where curiosity is the ultimate compass. Inspired by the vision of **liberal, responsible, and accessible education for all**, this framework unites global NGOs, academic innovators, communities, and governments to establish a sustainable, ethical, and future-ready unschool education ecosystem.  

---

## 🏛 Foundation History & Origin  
The U-EDU concept emerged in the early 2020s as educators, technologists, and community leaders sought **alternatives to rigid, industrial-era schooling**. Drawing from the principles of unschooling, open education, and democratic governance, the first pilot centres were established in **India, Kenya, and Finland**, demonstrating the power of curiosity-driven learning without standardized constraints.  

---

## 📖 Background  
By 2024, global demand for flexible, personalized learning had grown exponentially. However, a lack of **shared quality standards** limited scalability and credibility. The **U-EDU International Standards Council (U-ISC)** was created to provide **clear guidelines, ethical safeguards, and governance models** that preserve learner freedom while ensuring accountability. This README serves as both a **public declaration** and a **living document** for the movement.
